    /** TODO
     *
     **FOR PROJECT
     * show images when held during insert from list.
     * automatic adding of images from a certain directory
     * Buffer all useable images trimed.
     * I think we will need a file handler for this.
     *
     *
     ** LATER
     * Animation class
     * ImageLimbObject or extend imageObject // supports image parts in form of other objects within it.
     * Why am i using int buffer instead of byte buffer :/
     *  XXXX Add background and foreground image to image objects. XXX //use limb objects instead.
     *
     *
     * TO THINK OF
     * Fix so that there ain't double collision check every frame.
     * let image objects have applied forces for friction calculation.
     * **could work with just the velocity all the time. Increased force would then result in higher velocity to object.
     * **Remember to take out delta time!!
     *
     *
     * PROBLEMS
     * a tiny round problem with visuality.
