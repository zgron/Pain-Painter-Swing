Pain-Painter
============

A small pixel collision project I made back in 2014. The code is far from as clean and documented as I would like, 
there are lost features I wanted to implement before I realised the game bottle necked on the Java Swing graphics library,
tying the rendering to the CPU, which doesn't scale well. Since then I ventured out on other 3D projects.

Regardless, I find this as fun simple showcase java project.    

The project was coded in intellij.



TO RUN IT:
There is a runnable jar file under out/artifacts/Pain_Painter_jar/Pain Painter.jar

PS: There is no guarantee that later java versions will work. Java 11 should work.
